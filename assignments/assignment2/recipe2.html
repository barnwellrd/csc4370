			<h2 id="welcome">"Quick Steamed" Broccoli</h2>
			<p>
				Scientific studies have found steaming to be the best way to cook Broccoli to preserve its health-promoting nutrients and take advantage of its cholesterol-lowering benefits. It tastes best served the Mediterranean way with my easy-to-prepare dressing. Red onions add a sweet flavor to this recipe. Note: In the winter months Broccoli tends to be more tender and you'll only need to "Quick Steam" for 3 minutes.

			<h4>Prep and Cook Time: <span class="h4small">4 minutes</span></h4>
			<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 lb Broccoli</li>
				<li>1/2 medium red onion, sliced</li>
				<li>3 TBS extra virgin olive oil (or to taste)</li>
				<li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
				<li>1 medium clove garlic</li>
				<li>Sea salt and pepper to taste</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Directions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Fill bottom of steamer with 2 inches of water.</li>
				<li>While steam is building up in steamer, separate the florets from the stem as close to the florets as possible. Cut florets into quarters and slice the stems into 1/4-inch pieces. Let them sit for 5-10 minutes before steaming. Press or finely chop garlic and let garlic and sliced onions sit for at least 5 minutes.</li>
				<li>For al dent√© Broccoli, place the stems and sliced red onions in the steamer, cover with a tight fitting lid, and steam for 2 minutes. Add florets, cover, and steam for 4 minutes.</li>
				<li>Transfer to a bowl. For more flavor, toss Broccoli with the remaining ingredients while it is still hot. (Mediterranean Dressing does not need to be made separately.) Research shows that fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids found in foods, such as Broccoli, may be better absorbed when consumed with fat containing foods like extra virgin olive oil. Dressing helps tenderize Broccoli. 5-10 minutes after it is dressed you will find it will have become more tender.</li>
